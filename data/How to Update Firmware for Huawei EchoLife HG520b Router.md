Firmware is the software that runs on your router and controls its functions. Updating the firmware can fix some problems, improve the stability and security of your router, and add new features or enhancements. However, updating the firmware also involves some risks, such as losing your settings or bricking your router if the process fails or is interrupted. Therefore, you should always backup your settings before updating the firmware and follow the instructions carefully.
