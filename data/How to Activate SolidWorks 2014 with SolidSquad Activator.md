SolidWorks is a popular computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) software that allows users to create, simulate, and analyze 3D models of various products and systems. However, SolidWorks is not a free software and requires a license to use its full features. Some users may try to bypass this requirement by using a crack or activator program that can generate a fake license for SolidWorks.

One of these programs is the SolidSquad Activator, which claims to be able to activate SolidWorks versions from 2010 to 2016. However, some users have reported that this activator does not work properly and simply quits after hitting the activate button. This article will explain why this happens and how to fix it.
 
## Why does the SolidSquad Activator not work?

It may not be compatible with newer versions of Windows 10 or SolidWorks 2014. Moreover, the activator may contain malware or viruses that can harm your computer or compromise your privacy. The activator may also modify your hosts file or send data to unknown servers without your consent.
 
Another reason why the SolidSquad Activator may not work is that SolidWorks has improved its security and detection mechanisms over the years. It can easily identify and block fake licenses generated by the activator. It can also track down and sue users who pirate their software. Therefore, using the SolidSquad Activator is not only risky but also illegal.
 
## How to fix the SolidSquad Activator problem?
 
The best way to fix the SolidSquad Activator problem is to avoid using it altogether. Instead, you should purchase a legitimate license for SolidWorks from its official website or authorized resellers. This way, you can enjoy all the benefits and features of SolidWorks without any hassle or risk. You can also get technical support, updates, and access to online resources from SolidWorks.

For example, you can use FreeCAD, which is an open-source CAD software that can import and export SolidWorks files. You can also use Fusion 360, which is a cloud-based CAD/CAE software that offers a free plan for students, educators, and hobbyists.
 
## Conclusion
